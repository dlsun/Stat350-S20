If you complete it, it will replace your lowest grade on this week's activities. The points don't justify the time, but I hope that the case study is interesting and a good review of many concepts you have learned this week. It is due at midnight on Monday, if you want to do it.

## Monday, June 29

1. Learn about ["The Hypergeometric Distribution"](https://dlsun.github.io/probability/hypergeometric.html), then [measure your understanding](https://canvas.calpoly.edu/courses/25458/assignments/68722). You should be comfortable calculating probabilities using either 
Python or R; you do not need to know both. I encourage you to use Python or R in Colab, like I do in the lesson, so you do not 
need to install any software on your own machine.
2. Complete the [simulation activity](https://canvas.calpoly.edu/courses/25458/assignments/68812).
3. (Optional) Complete [Case Study 1](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/10P6JPVswCnySqycFPPxPZXocTim5xMmI).
