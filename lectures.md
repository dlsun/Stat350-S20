## Friday, June 26

1. [Analyze the results from yesterday's simulation](https://canvas.calpoly.edu/courses/25458/assignments/68311).
2. Learn about ["Random Variables"](https://dlsun.github.io/probability/rv.html), then [measure your understanding](https://canvas.calpoly.edu/courses/25458/assignments/68285).

4. (Optional) Work with a partner on [Case Study 1](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/10P6JPVswCnySqycFPPxPZXocTim5xMmI) on the probability of winning in the casino game craps. If you complete it, it will replace your lowest grade on this week's activities. The points don't justify the time, but I hope that the case study is interesting and a good review of many concepts you have learned this week. It is due at midnight on Monday, if you want to do it.

## Monday, June 29
